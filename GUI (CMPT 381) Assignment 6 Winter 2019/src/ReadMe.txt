This assignment was used to demonstrate undo/redo and group selection through a GUI.

Controls for the GUI:

a: create a "blob", a purple circle

ctrl+c: copy selected group or blob to the clipboard

ctrl+x: remove the selected blob or groups to the clipboard

ctrl+v: paste the selected blob or group that has been saved to the clipboard

g (when blobs are selected): groups the blobs into a blob group


Other Controls:

- clicking a blob or blob group selects it; Turns them pink; re-clicking deselects the object.

- clicking and dragging a selecting object moves it.

- clicking and dragging on the canvas starts highlighting a region to select the objects within that region.
